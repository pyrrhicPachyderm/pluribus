# Pluribus

> **_NOTE:_**
> Pluribus is a work in progress.
> The following documents its intended aims, features, and usage, serving as a to-do list and specification as much as anything else.

Pluribus is a utility to help create multi-volume books in LaTeX.
It generates the volumes in separate PDF files, and as an omnibus edition.
Furthermore, it can generate pluribuses&mdash;editions containing any subset of volumes you select.
It manages contents tables and indices within every volume and edition.
Lastly, by leveraging [`zref-xr`](https://ctan.org/pkg/zref), Pluribus facilitates references and hyperlinks within and between volumes.

## Using Pluribus

Pluribus consists of a script that generates a Makefile, which in turn can be used to compile your book's volumes, omnibus, and pluribuses.
By default, it generates a standalone Makefile.
However, it may be configured to generate a set of rules that can be incorporated into a project's overarching Makefile.

Pluribus relies on a configuration file, in the [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) format.
This can be used to modify the behaviour of Pluribus, such as selecting between a standalone and partial Makefile.
More importantly, however, the configuration file defines the volumes to be managed by Pluribus.
By default, Pluribus looks for the file `pluribus.toml`, in the directory where the Pluribus script is run.
The contents of configuration file are detailed [below](#user-content-the-configuration-file).

Pluribus also requires one directory for each volume.
This directory should contain a `content.tex` file.
The `content.tex` file contains all the main matter for its relevant volume; everything that goes between LaTeX's `\mainmatter` and `\backmatter` commands.
This file is loaded in LaTeX using the [`\import`](https://ctan.org/pkg/import) command.
As such, it can safely `\input`, `\include`, `\includegraphics`, or `\subimport` files relative to its own location.
For example, you could place each chapter in a separate file, alongside `content.tex`, and import it directly.

Alongside the directories for the volumes, Pluribus creates its own `.pluribus/` directory.
This directory, as well as Makefiles generated by Pluribus, should be excluded from a projects version control system (for example, with a `.gitignore` file).
