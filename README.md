# Pluribus

> **_NOTE:_**
> Pluribus is a work in progress.
> The following documents its intended aims, features, and usage, serving as a to-do list and specification as much as anything else.

Pluribus is a utility to help create multi-volume books in LaTeX.
It generates the volumes in separate PDF files, and as an omnibus edition.
Furthermore, it can generate pluribuses&mdash;editions containing any subset of volumes you select.
It manages contents tables and indices within every volume and edition.
Lastly, by leveraging [`zref-xr`](https://ctan.org/pkg/zref), Pluribus facilitates references and hyperlinks within and between volumes.

## Using Pluribus

Pluribus consists of a script that generates a Makefile, which in turn can be used to compile your book's volumes, omnibus, and pluribuses.
By default, it generates a standalone Makefile.
However, it may be configured to generate a set of rules that can be incorporated into a project's overarching Makefile.

In order to use Pluribus, each volume should be written as a LaTeX file including only the main matter.
This is all the content that would be placed between LaTeX's `\mainmatter` and `\backmatter` commands.
The front matter and back matter are managed separately by Pluribus.
Each main matter file is loaded in LaTeX using the [`\import`](https://ctan.org/pkg/import) command.
As such, it may lie in any location on the file system, and can safely `\input`, `\include`, `\includegraphics`, or `\subimport` files relative to its own location.

Pluribus relies on a configuration file, in the [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) format.
This can be used to modify the behaviour of Pluribus, such as selecting between a standalone and partial Makefile.
More importantly, however, the configuration file defines the volumes to be managed by Pluribus.
The path to the configuration file must be provided as an argument to the Pluribus script, when it is run.
The contents of configuration file are detailed [below](#user-content-the-configuration-file).

Pluribus creates its own `.pluribus/` directory; by default, this lies alongside the provided configuration file.
This directory, as well the Makefile generated by Pluribus, should be excluded from a project's version control system (for example, with a `.gitignore` file).

### Pluribus Script Argument

The Pluribus script takes exactly one argument: the path to the configuration file.
Every path in the configuration file should be relative to the location of the configuration file itself.
Additionally, by default, the `.pluribus/` directory and the resulting Makefile are created alongside the configuration file.
